## Installation

To get started with the AI Interpreter project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeelsheladiya/AI-interpreter-tool.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AI-interpreter-tool
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the setup.py:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

To run the AI Interpreter, use the following command:

```bash
python ai_interpreter/interface/user_interface.py
```

This will start the interactive console interface, allowing you to enter commands with autocomplete capability.

Available commands:

- `run`: Execute a command (default).
- `exit`: Exit the interpreter.
- `help`: Display available commands.
- `info`: Show information about the interpreter.

## Testing

Before committing your code changes, please ensure the following:

1. **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests to ensure code correctness and catch regressions. Use a testing framework like `pytest`:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Code Formatting**: Make sure your code is properly formatted using `black`. You can format your code by running:

   ```bash
   black ai_interpreter
   ```

3. **Linter**: Use a linter like `flake8` to check for code style and potential issues:

   ```bash
   flake8 .
   ```

4. **Pre-commit Hooks**: You can use pre-commit hooks to automatically enforce code formatting and linting. To set up pre-commit hooks, run:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

   The hooks will run automatically before each commit.

5. **Coverage**: Measure code coverage to ensure that your unit tests cover a significant portion of your codebase. You can use a tool like `coverage.py` for this purpose.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `ai_interpreter`: Contains the main Python package.
  - `core`: Core logic for the AI interpreter.
  - `cli`: Command-line interface related code.
  - `interface`: User interface code using the `rich` library.
  - `llms`: Language Model Services (LLMS) code (NLP and machine learning, if applicable).
- `tests`: Unit tests for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.
- `setup.py`: Project packaging and metadata.
- `LICENSE`: Project license (e.g., MIT License).
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Configuration for pre-commit hooks (code formatting, linting).
- `.travis.yml`: Configuration for Travis CI (continuous integration).
